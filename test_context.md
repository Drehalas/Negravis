# Comprehensive Knowledge Base: 0G Network - The First Decentralized AI Operating System

## Executive Summary

0G (Zero Gravity) represents a paradigm shift in blockchain infrastructure, positioning itself as the world's first decentralized AI operating system. Unlike traditional blockchains that struggle with AI's computational and storage demands, 0G was architected from the ground up to bridge the critical gap between Web2 AI capabilities and Web3 decentralization. The platform orchestrates hardware resources (storage, compute) and software assets (data, models) to handle AI workloads at unprecedented scale.

## Network Architecture and Core Components

### Modular Blockchain Design

0G implements a revolutionary modular architecture where each component operates independently while maintaining seamless interoperability. This design philosophy allows developers to utilize specific 0G services without migrating entire applications. The four core modules include:
